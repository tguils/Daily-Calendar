# Daily-Calendar
## Description

This application is a Work Day Scheduler that allows the user to enter in events/appointments to their calander by hour. The application is dynamic and color codes hours that are in the past as grey, present as red, and future as green. The calander hours are 9AM to 6PM to go along with a typical work day.


## Usage

When you enter the application the user is presented with the current time and date, which is dynamic. The user will also see a table below that which shows the hours 9AM to 6PM with text boxes and save buttons next to them. The user will see that the hours in the past are grey, the hours in the future are green, and the current hour is red. The user will be able to click the text box next to the hours and type in the event or appointment they may have at that time. That input is saved in local storage and displayed on the page and kept there. The user is able to delete the events they typed in as well.
